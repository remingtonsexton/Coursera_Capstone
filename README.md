# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Traffic Accident Severity in the UK

This work was part of a IBM Capstone Project, which aimed to model traffic accident severity in the UK using supervised multi-class classification.  This project was completed on 26 October 2020 for the completion of the IBM Professional Certificate program in data science, proof of which can be found [here](https://github.com/remingtonsexton/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Coursera%20BX3YXR7JKZA7.pdf).
